# Contributing

If you find a bug or have a feature request you are free to open a Github Issue at any time. These will be addressed promptly after being created.

If you are interested in contributing to the repo that's great! Before doing so, contact me via direct message or a Github Issue to let me know what you would like to add. That way we can avoid overwritting each other's work in the event I am also working on the library.
